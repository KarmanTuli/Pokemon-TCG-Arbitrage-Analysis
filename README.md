I created an end-to-end data pipeline to identify arbitrage opportunities within the local marketplace on OfferUp relative to Pokemon Trading Card Game market prices. utilized stealth scraping, Gemini 2.5 Flash for human-like cleaning, fuzzy-matching based on key logic and business rules, and liquidity analysis based on product names.   Pokemon has now turned into the highest-grossing media franchise of all time, with the 2026 market offering arbitrage opportunities and potential profit for thousands of English sealed products. I have personally pursued this myself, and have gone through several challenges - specifically with OfferUp - in finding relevant, valid listings with profit potential. This data pipeline captures market prices from TCGPlayer and thousands of listings from OfferUp, then match the two to identify opportunities. Based on the top 100 opportunities, I have also added liquidity factors, such as Total Daily Sold and Avg. Daily Sold within last three months. All of this data is stored in a tcg_inventory SQLite database, which ultimately connects live to PowerBI for real-time decision making and analysis.  NOTE: Must need Gemini 2.5 Flash key to run gemini_cleaner script. Have not included my gemini key for safety!
